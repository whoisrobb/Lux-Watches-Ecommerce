Our comprehensive range of services ensures that your luxury watches and accessories remain in peak condition, allowing you to enjoy them for generations to come.</p><p><br></p><h3>Why Trust Lux Watches for Watch Repairs and Services?</h3><p><br></p><p>Watches are not just accessories; they are intricate pieces of artistry and engineering. Over time, they can experience wear and tear, impacting their performance and appearance. At Lux Watches, we stand by our commitment to excellence in watch repair and maintenance. Here's why you should choose us:</p><p><br></p><h3>Expert Watchmakers</h3><p><br></p><p>Our select network of watchmakers is accredited by prestigious Swiss brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, Omega, and others. These experts possess a deep understanding of the craft and have honed their skills to perfection. They can often provide a significantly shorter turnaround time than most jewelers, minimizing the time your watch is away from your wrist.</p><p><br></p><h3>Precision Maintenance</h3><p><br></p><p>Just as the moving parts in a car require maintenance by specialist mechanics, the intricate physical processes that power your watch require expert care. Over time, even the most meticulously crafted timepieces experience some degree of wear and tear. Lux Watches' skilled watchmakers are equipped to diagnose and address these issues with precision.</p><p><br></p><h3>Transparent Process</h3><p><br></p><p>Transparency is at the core of our service. When you entrust your watch to us, you can expect a clear and systematic process that ensures your timepiece receives the attention it deserves. Our commitment to transparency ensures that you know precisely what is happening with your watch throughout its servicing journey.</p><p><br></p><h3>Watch Maintenance: Preserving the Artistry of Time</h3><p><br></p><p>Your timepiece is built to the most exacting standards, with every mechanical watch containing at least 130 parts, some of which are fractions of a millimeter thick, all perfectly aligned to achieve the delicate balancing act that makes a watch run 24 hours a day. However, like any precision instrument, it requires regular maintenance.</p><p><br></p><h3>Service Intervals</h3><p><br></p><p>Different watch manufacturers recommend different service intervals, but the industry standard is a service every 3-5 years for most brands. Regular servicing ensures that your watch continues to perform at its best, providing you with accurate timekeeping and preserving its beauty.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Process of a Mechanical Service</h3><p><br></p><p>When you entrust your watch to Lux Watches for a service, a meticulous 10-step process begins:</p><p><br></p><h3>1. Disassembly</h3><p><br></p><p>The strap is carefully removed, and the case is opened to provide access to the movement. Each of the movement's 130+ parts is systematically removed, inspected, and categorized. The case is disassembled into its constituent parts.</p><p><br></p><h3>2. Cleaning</h3><p><br></p><p>All components, from the tiniest gears to the case components, are meticulously cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using specially formulated cleaning solutions. This ensures that no debris or contaminants interfere with the delicate workings of your watch.</p><p><br></p><h3>3. Replacement</h3><p><br></p><p>Every part of the movement is inspected for wear and damage. Any parts that show signs of wear or damage are replaced with genuine replacement parts to ensure the continued precision and longevity of your timepiece.</p><p><br></p><h3>4. Rebuilding the Movement</h3><p><br></p><p>The movement is methodically reassembled, with each component being carefully lubricated using specially synthesized long-life fluids. Our watchmakers utilize magnification of up to 50X to ensure the precise application of these lubricants.</p><p><br></p><h3>5. Timing and Calibration</h3><p><br></p><p>Using specialist audio recording equipment, the 'beat' of the movement is measured against exact measurements and adjusted to ensure precise timekeeping accuracy. This step is crucial to ensure that your watch continues to keep impeccable time.</p><p><br></p><h3>6. Refinishing</h3><p><br></p><p>If you choose to have your watch case and bracelet refurbished, our specialists use state-of-the-art machines and compounds to remove scratches, restore shine, and reapply any finishes, returning your watch to its original luster.</p><p><br></p><h3>7. Case Reassembly</h3><p><br></p><p>The cleaned case is meticulously reassembled, and the movement is expertly fitted and reconnected to the dial. All gaskets are replaced to initiate the process of making the watch water-resistant.</p><p><br></p><h3>8. Water Resistance</h3><p><br></p><p>Ensuring the water resistance of your watch is a critical part of the process. The case is pressurized and vacuum-sealed to create a watertight seal, ensuring that your watch can withstand everyday exposure to moisture.</p><p><br></p><h3>9. Testing</h3><p><br></p><p>Before your watch is returned to you, it undergoes rigorous testing. Using a variety of equipment, we assess both water resistance and shock resistance. Watches are then subjected to several days of testing in various positions to guarantee that they are keeping time and running flawlessly.</p><p><br></p><h3>10. Quality Control</h3><p><br></p><p>Every watch undergoes a final visual check to ensure precise timekeeping and normal functioning. The case is inspected to ensure a superb finish has been achieved. Only after passing these rigorous quality control checks is your watch ready for your collection.</p><p><br></p><h3> How the Repair Process Works</h3><p><br></p><p>Upon receiving your timepiece, we securely send it to the appropriate expert in our network of accredited watchmakers. Due to the varying nature of necessary work, an initial assessment of the watch will be completed. You will then be provided with an estimate of the work required. With your permission, the watchmaker will then commence the intricate task of repairing and maintaining your watch.</p><p><br></p><h3>Our Warranty</h3><p><br></p><p>At Lux Watches, we stand by the quality of our work. Every timepiece repaired by us is covered by a 12-month warranty on the completed work, with the exception of valets and refurbishments. If you experience issues caused by the same problem within 12 months of repair completion, we will return your watch to the watchmaker for a thorough repair,</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;completely free of charge.</p><p><br></p><h3>Request a Service</h3><p><br></p><p>Use the form below to make a Repairs and Services enquiry. A member of our dedicated team will promptly get in touch with you to discuss your specific needs and guide you through the process of entrusting your treasured timepiece to Lux Watches.</p><p><br></p><p>At Lux Watches, we are not just repairing watches; we are preserving moments and traditions, one tick at a time.</p>"
